I had to restart this project and hopefully I don't run into the same problem that I had previously. Could not figure out what the problem was (yet). Hopefully, as I am redoing the tutorial I will find out what the problem was when the time comes.

Tutorial YT Playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIjdNHWULhPSZFDzQU6AnbVQNNo1NTRpd

Required before starting Video 2/Part 2:
    1.1. npm install -g @angular/cli
    1.2. npm install -g nodemon
    2. Install MongoDB (link in README, not needed till Part 3)
    3. Install Postman (link in README, not needed till Part 3)

    In a new terminal shell opened to project root folder:
        ng new frontend --style=scss --routing=true
        cd frontend
        npm install bulma --save
        ng g c pages/TaskView
        ng serve

    Part 2 completed around 5:05 PM. Uploading progress to GitHub.
    Part 3 started around 5:15 PM.

    Created folder in project root called 'api'

    Opened new terminal shell to project root folder:
        cd api
        npm init        - NOTE: Pressed enter through all questions asked after running npm init
        npm install express --save
        nodemon app.js

        npm install mongoose --save

    Got to Part 3 adding code to mongoose.js.



Thu. 05/26/22', 1:27 PM | PC
    Continuing at Part 3 note left above.

    Within Angular-Task-Manager-Tutorial/api directory:
        npm install body-parser --save

    Finished Part 3 at 2:19 PM. Moving on to Part 4 now.

    Current active terminal shells:
        #1: ./Angular-Task-Manager-Tutorial/api/ :
            running "nodemon app.js"
        #2: ./Angular-Task-Manager-Tutorial/frontend/ :
            running "ng serve"

    I just created a third terminal shell in ./Angular-Task-Manager-Tutorial/frontend/ and:
        ng generate service Task
        ng generate service WebRequest

    Finished Part 4 at 2:46 PM. Moving on to Part 5 now.

    Within the third terminal shell mentioned above:
        ng generate component pages/new-list

    Part 5 finished at 3:34 PM. Everything working so far. No problems like previously.
    Going to CTRL+C the api and frontend directory servers respectively and close EVERYTHING I have open in Windows.
    Will add to log shortly after reopening everything and starting servers to see if it's still working.

    I ran into the problem, began doing a massive breakdown into the problem, what it is, and how I can approach fixing it. I found in the comments in Part 7 that this problem is addressed in Part 10. Which it is, Part 10 at ~1:15 in the video shows the if else statement that will completely negate the error. Problem solved.

    Going to upload to GitHub and then move on to Part 6 and Part 7.

    Considering this project is a complete redo of Part 1-5 but because last time I was dumb and instead of trying to reseach into the problem more just redid the project in a new GitHub repository, I am going to delete the previous GitHub reposity. This one is more organized since I knew what I was doing leading up to this point.

    As it's 4:45 PM and it took me a good hour today trying to figure out my error, I will continue this tomorrow, not today.



Fri. 05/27/22', 1:10 PM | PC
    Starting with Part 6. Hopefully I get to Part 10 today before I sleep whenever that may be.

    Started with the three main terminal shells:
    #1: ./Angular-Task-Manager-Tutorial/api>:
        nodemon app.js
    #2: ./Angular-Task-Manager-Tutorial/frontend>:
        ng serve

    I decided to add font-awesome, might come in use. Followed this link: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fortawesome/angular-fontawesome
    #3: ./Angular-Task-Manager-Tutorial/frontend>:
        ng add @fortawesome/angular-fontawesome@
            I selected Font Awesome 6 and Free Solid Icons, Free Regular Icons, Free Brands Icons.
            https://fontawesome.com/search?m=free&s=regular%2Csolid%2Cbrands  <-- All Free Solid, Regular, and Brands Icons.

    Part 6 done at 1:40. Took a bit longer since I decided to add font-awesome instead of using anything else.
    Moving on to Part 7 without uploading to GitHub because Part 6 was only a few lines of code.

    Within the 3rd terminal shell:
        ng generate component pages/new-task

    Part 7 now complete at 2:30 PM. Going to upload progress to GitHub, take a short break, and continue.



Fri. 05/27/22', 4:05 PM | PC
    Continuing with Part 8.

    !NOTE: from here on, instead of me repeating "still using the 3 terminal shells I normally use, lets just always assume it's implied unless otherwise noted.


    TODO: Add a Working With Project section to readme. Include setup when coding (the 3 terminals) and also how to install/setup the project. Also, explain working with MongoDB community server downloaded application.


    Finished Part 8 at 4:50 PM. Uploading progress to GitHub and moving on to Part 9.



Fri. 05/27/22', 4:55 PM | PC
    Continuing with Part 9.

    Within terminal #3:
        ng g c pages/SigninPage

    Turns out I am retarded. Part 9 ~2:35 timestamp he shows the simplest way to add font awesome to the application, where I used ng to add it and then would have had to add every specific icon I wanted to use manually in the component.ts for every component.html using an icon.
    I deleted @fortawesome folder from node_modules and removed anything related to "fort" and therefore "fortawesome" from files like package.js.

    From now on, when wanting to use a icon, search this link: https://fontawesome.com/v5/search?s=solid

    Since the Part 9 video is 1 hour long, I stopped at 12:55 for today. Hopefully I can actually get good sleep tonight and wake up with plenty of energy unlike the past few weeks.



Sun. 05/29/22', 2:03 PM | PC Reset to Windows 11
    Within a terminal shell at /api/:
        npm install lodash --save
        npm install jsonwebtoken --save

    Just too tired today to continue this. Stopped video at 21:10 exactly.



Mon. 05/30/22', ~3:15 PM | PC
    Within terminal shell at /api/:
        npm install bcryptjs --save

    Stopped at 47.30



Tue. 05/31/22', 1:00 PM | PC

    Took a break around 3:30 PM. Back now at 5:20 PM.

    Part 9 finally finished. Time: 6:11 PM.
    Took so long because I experienced a few errors, many being syntax errors caused by me. The consistency with the words being used are a bit too consistent, causing me to type "refresh" as "referesh" and "session" when it's supposed to be "sessions" and vice versa. In reality, I would never do the same thing this person does for the tutorial, but it's a tutorial. For example: this person uses the word "title" for both the list title, which is understandable, but also the task body within the list is also considered "title". That should be a different name but it's w/e.

    Uploading progress so far and moving on to part 10.



Tue. 05/31/22', 6:20 PM | PC
    Working on Part 10.

    Within a terminal shell at /frontend/:
        ng g s Auth                     (ng generate service <name>)
        ng g s WebReqInterceptor

    Part 10 finished at 7:33 PM. Uploading progress to GitHub and continuing tomorrow.



Wed. 06/01/22', 5:38 PM | PC
    Working on Part 11

    Part 11 finished at 6:58 PM. Uploading to GitHub and then going to start working on Part 12 as much as I can.
