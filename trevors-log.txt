I had to restart this project and hopefully I don't run into the same problem that I had previously. Could not figure out what the problem was (yet). Hopefully, as I am redoing the tutorial I will find out what the problem was when the time comes.

Tutorial YT Playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIjdNHWULhPSZFDzQU6AnbVQNNo1NTRpd

Required before starting Video 2/Part 2:
    1. npm install -g @angular/cli
    2. Install MongoDB (link in README, not needed till Part 3)
    3. Install Postman (link in README, not needed till Part 3)

    In a new terminal shell opened to project root folder:
        ng new frontend --style=scss --routing=true
        cd frontend
        npm install bulma --save
        ng g c pages/TaskView
        ng serve

    Part 2 completed around 5:05 PM. Uploading progress to GitHub.
    Part 3 started around 5:15 PM.

    Created folder in project root called 'api'

    Opened new terminal shell to project root folder:
        cd api
        npm init        - NOTE: Pressed enter through all questions asked after running npm init
        npm install express --save
        nodemon app.js

        npm install mongoose --save

    Got to Part 3 adding code to mongoose.js.

    Continuing at Part 3 note left above.

    Within Angular-Task-Manager-Tutorial/api directory:
        npm install body-parser --save

    Finished Part 3 at 2:19 PM. Moving on to Part 4 now.

    Current active terminal shells:
        #1: ./Angular-Task-Manager-Tutorial/api/ :
            running "nodemon app.js"
        #2: ./Angular-Task-Manager-Tutorial/frontend/ :
            running "ng serve"

    I just created a third terminal shell in ./Angular-Task-Manager-Tutorial/frontend/ and:
        ng generate service Task
        ng generate service WebRequest

    Finished Part 4 at 2:46 PM. Moving on to Part 5 now.

    Within the third terminal shell mentioned above:
        ng generate component pages/new-list

    Part 5 finished at 3:34 PM. Everything working so far. No problems like previously.
    Going to CTRL+C the api and frontend directory servers respectively and close EVERYTHING I have open in Windows.
    Will add to log shortly after reopening everything and starting servers to see if it's still working.

    I ran into the problem, began doing a massive breakdown into the problem, what it is, and how I can approach fixing it. I found in the comments in Part 7 that this problem is addressed in Part 10. Which it is, Part 10 at ~1:15 in the video shows the if else statement that will completely negate the error. Problem solved.

    Going to upload to GitHub and then move on to Part 6 and Part 7.

    Considering this project is a complete redo of Part 1-5 but because last time I was dumb and instead of trying to reseach into the problem more just redid the project in a new GitHub repository, I am going to delete the previous GitHub reposity. This one is more organized since I knew what I was doing leading up to this point.

    As it's 4:45 PM and it took me a good hour today trying to figure out my error, I will continue this tomorrow, not today.

    Starting with Part 6. Hopefully I get to Part 10 today before I sleep whenever that may be.

    Started with the three main terminal shells:
    #1: ./Angular-Task-Manager-Tutorial/api>:
        nodemon app.js
    #2: ./Angular-Task-Manager-Tutorial/frontend>:
        ng serve

    I decided to add font-awesome, might come in use. Followed this link: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fortawesome/angular-fontawesome
    #3: ./Angular-Task-Manager-Tutorial/frontend>:
        ng add @fortawesome/angular-fontawesome@
            I selected Font Awesome 6 and Free Solid Icons, Free Regular Icons, Free Brands Icons.
            https://fontawesome.com/search?m=free&s=regular%2Csolid%2Cbrands  <-- All Free Solid, Regular, and Brands Icons.

    Part 6 done at 1:40. Took a bit longer since I decided to add font-awesome instead of using anything else.
    Moving on to Part 7 without uploading to GitHub because Part 6 was only a few lines of code.

    Within the 3rd terminal shell:
        ng generate component pages/new-task

    Part 7 now complete at 2:30 PM. Going to upload progress to GitHub, take a short break, and continue.
