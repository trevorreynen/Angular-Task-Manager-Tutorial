I had to restart this project and hopefully I don't run into the same problem that I had previously. Could not figure out what the problem was (yet). Hopefully, as I am redoing the tutorial I will find out what the problem was when the time comes.

    Continuing at Part 3 note left above.

    Within Angular-Task-Manager-Tutorial/api directory:
        npm install body-parser --save

    Finished Part 3 at 2:19 PM. Moving on to Part 4 now.

    Current active terminal shells:
        #1: ./Angular-Task-Manager-Tutorial/api/ :
            running "nodemon app.js"
        #2: ./Angular-Task-Manager-Tutorial/frontend/ :
            running "ng serve"

    I just created a third terminal shell in ./Angular-Task-Manager-Tutorial/frontend/ and:
        ng generate service Task
        ng generate service WebRequest

    Finished Part 4 at 2:46 PM. Moving on to Part 5 now.
