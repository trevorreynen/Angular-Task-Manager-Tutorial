# Angular and MongoDB Tutorial

This GitHub Repository is based on one and only one tutorial: [Build a Task Manager Application From Scratch (MEAN Stack)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIjdNHWULhPSZFDzQU6AnbVQNNo1NTRpd).

This project was started for myself to learn the basics of Angular. Throughout the tutorial, I added personal notes to a file called "trevors-log.txt" which contains nearly everything I did including terminal commands. It's fairly unorganized and probably not useful for anyone except myself. However, in case I need to reference something in the future, I have that file.
