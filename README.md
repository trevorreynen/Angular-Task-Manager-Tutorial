# Angular Task Manager Tutorial

This GitHub Repository is based on one and only one tutorial: [Build a Task Manager Application From Scratch (MEAN Stack)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIjdNHWULhPSZFDzQU6AnbVQNNo1NTRpd).

This project was started for myself to learn the basics of Angular. This tutorial is, in short, supposed to be a game database website. It was really difficult to find an Angular Tutorial that didn't have multiple comments saying "show source code" because they didn't show everything necessary in the video(s). There are many other reason's I am sort of stuck following this tutorial, but this seems to be a complete tutorial from scratch that I can completely hear and understand the person doing the tutorial.

Throughout the tutorial, I added personal notes to a file called "trevors-log.txt" which contains nearly everything I did including terminal commands. It's unorganized and probably not useful for anyone except myself. However, in case I need to reference something in the future, I have that file.
